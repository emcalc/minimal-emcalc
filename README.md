## ✨ What is minimal emcalc?

**emcalc minimal** is a lightweight, open-source tool designed to calculate energy from mass using Einstein's famous formula:  
\[
E = mc^2
\]

But it doesn’t stop there:

- 📄 **No bloat and one file**: Great for Richard Stallman and Bloat haters😀
- 🧠 **Educational**: Great for students, teachers, and science lovers  
- 🛠️ **Open Source** and licensed under **GNU GPLv3**
